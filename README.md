# Jigsaw Multilingual Toxic Comment Classification üåçüí¨

In this notebook, we tackle the problem of classifying toxic comments in multiple languages. This project aims to explore the journey from basic **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** to the latest and most advanced **deep learning architectures** in NLP. We will work step-by-step through various techniques to solve the problem of detecting toxicity in text, with a focus on **multilingual text**.

## üìù **Project Overview**
The Jigsaw dataset contains comments labeled as **toxic** or **non-toxic** across various languages. Our goal is to develop a model that can classify whether a given comment is toxic or not, using state-of-the-art techniques in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. This notebook covers both basic and advanced methods in RNNs and modern deep learning models for text classification.

## üìö **Key Topics Covered**
Here is a roadmap of the topics we will cover in this notebook, progressing from basic to advanced models:

### 1. **Simple RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks)** ü§ñ
   - We start with the fundamentals of **RNNs**: understanding how they work, their ability to process sequential data, and how they can be applied to text classification.
   - RNNs are the simplest type of neural network for handling sequence data, which is crucial for NLP tasks.

### 2. **Word Embeddings** üåê
   - **Word embeddings** provide a dense representation of words in a continuous vector space.
   - We‚Äôll dive into what **word embeddings** are, how they work, and how to obtain them for multilingual datasets. We'll explore techniques like **Word2Vec** and **GloVe**.

### 3. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** ‚è≥
   - **LSTMs** are a more advanced form of RNN that can capture long-range dependencies better than simple RNNs.
   - We will learn how LSTMs address the vanishing gradient problem, making them powerful for sequence prediction tasks like text classification.

### 4. **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)** üîÑ
   - **GRUs** are another variant of RNNs that combine the forget and input gates of LSTM into a single gate, making them computationally more efficient.
   - We'll see how GRUs perform similarly to LSTMs but with fewer parameters.

### 5. **Bidirectional RNNs** üîÅ
   - **Bi-directional RNNs** are designed to process data in both forward and backward directions, capturing information from both past and future contexts in the sequence.

### 6. **Encoder-Decoder Models (Seq2Seq Models)** üîÑ‚û°Ô∏è
   - **Encoder-Decoder** architecture is the foundation of many state-of-the-art NLP models. We will cover how **Seq2Seq** models work, and how they are used for tasks like translation, summarization, and classification.

### 7. **Attention Models** üß†
   - **Attention mechanisms** help the model focus on important parts of the input sequence, improving performance on long sequences by learning which words to pay more attention to.
   - We will learn how attention works and implement it for better comment classification.

### 8. **Transformers - "Attention is All You Need"** ‚ö°
   - The **Transformer** model revolutionized NLP by entirely eliminating the need for recurrence, relying solely on **self-attention** mechanisms.
   - We'll explore the architecture of Transformers, how they work, and how they outperform traditional RNNs and LSTMs in many tasks.

### 9. **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** üöÄ
   - **BERT** is a pre-trained Transformer model that is fine-tuned for specific NLP tasks, including toxic comment classification.
   - We‚Äôll use **BERT** for feature extraction and classification, leveraging its power for language understanding.

## üß† **Approach and Methodology**

### **Data Preprocessing**:
- **Text cleaning**: Removing noise, such as punctuation, stopwords, and special characters.
- **Tokenization**: Converting the text into tokens that the model can process.
- **Padding**: Ensuring that all input sequences are of the same length.
- **Multilingual Handling**: As we are working with multiple languages, we will use techniques that ensure the models can generalize across different language contexts.

### **Model Building**:
- Start with a **simple RNN** and gradually move to **LSTM**, **GRU**, and **Bi-directional RNNs**.
- Use **Encoder-Decoder** models and **Attention** mechanisms for advanced feature extraction.
- Implement the **Transformer** architecture and fine-tune **BERT** for toxicity classification.




## üöÄ **Key Technologies Used**
- **Python**: Main programming language for data manipulation, analysis, and model building.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning frameworks used for building and training models.
- **NLTK** and **spaCy**: NLP libraries for preprocessing text and handling tokenization.
- **Transformers (Hugging Face)**: Pre-trained Transformer models like **BERT** for feature extraction and fine-tuning.
